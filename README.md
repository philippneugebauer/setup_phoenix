# Utilize Phoenix Better

That's the corresponding code of my [Utilize Phoenix Better](https://speakerdeck.com/philippneugebauer/utilize-phoenix-better) talk.
It has implemented the update proposal of `phoenix` dependencies and utilizes also the other recommended libraries. Thereby, it demonstrates their usage in a simple setup.


## Talk Description

Starting a new project, especially based on a new technology, requires a lot decisions about the technology stack.
Unfortunately, the later a decision is proven to be wrong, the more expensive it is to correct the decision.

In this talk, Philipp shares his ideas for a good setup for Phoenix and also discusses its benefits.
Thereby, he covers all steps from development to production.
He will start with beneficial updates of the Phoenix environment to avoid later migrations.
Subsequently, he provides useful hints for development and suggests libraries,
after which he demonstrates how you could easily setup your CI/CD pipeline to finally host the application.
